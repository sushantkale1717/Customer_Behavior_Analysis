In this project, we're exploring customer behavior in online shopping from various angles. We're examining data on customer demographics, purchasing patterns, and churn rates to gain a comprehensive understanding of their behavior. Our objective is not just to analyze churn but also to explore different aspects of customer behavior. By doing so, we aim to provide comprehensive insights that will inform strategic decisions and optimize our e-commerce business.
